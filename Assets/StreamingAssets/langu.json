    "scene03-0006": "We've obtained the lava.",
    "scene03-0004": "Lets go SANIA",
    "scene03-0020": "A carrot. Pete would LOVE this. Lets go bring it to him.",
    "photosynthesis8": "Lets get to work! Combine the O2 and H2O molecules we collected in space together and give them to the tree.",
    "StartButton": "PLAY",
    "treeBubble1": "Combine the H20 and C02 molecules to begin photosynthesis!",
    "scene05-0009": "We have it! Lets go talk to Pete and make our way back to the Tree of Life!",
    "combatSceneS2": "Lets collect some of the Carbon Dioxide these soda cans generate after they're destroyed as well as the H2O from the water bottles. You never know when you will need water!",
    "scene05-0007": "Two solutions are combined and a quick exchange of partners occurs causing the formation of an insoluble solid that falls or precipitates to the bottom of the container the solutions are combined in.",
    "photosynthesis10": "There is lava up ahead!? Lets collect some!",
    "scene03-0019": "Ah you found a Daucus carota.",
    "combatSceneS3": "Alright! Lets go! We will need to collect 10 of each! Press (SPACE) to fire your laser at the bottles and cans.",
    "scene02-0013": "You did it! Now we have a product that produces a GAS. Lets fix up our ship and get our balloon inflated.",
    "scene02-0006": "Yes! I can talk! You crashed your ship into me, and it appears you are stranded. Let me help you. You have landed in Reaction Forest. Everything here functions using chemical reactions. Your balloon has run out of gas.",
    "TapHereButton": "Tap Here To Cook!",
    "scene03-0005": "beep beep click brrrr",
    "scene02-0010": "Let's get your balloon filled up again so you can find the REACTANTS for my potion. Be careful though. The ground moves in some places! Fall off and you will end up back here talking to me.",
    "torchLesson": "Awesome! Now I have a flame to melt the ice with! The temperature change in the wood is what caused the chemical reaction to take place which created a flame!",
    "scene02-0001": "That was scary! Luckily we are still in one piece. Well...I am.",
    "photosynthesis4": "I am very hungry! I have no carbon dioxide or water in here! Its all ice!",
    "scene01-0004": "AH!!!",
    "scene03-0017": "I'm on it! Lets go SANIA!",
    "scene05-0003": "Be sure to jump on them when you see them. Collect enough of their jelly, and you will have the ingredients necessary for the potion.",
    "scene02-0002": "Yes. Lucky indeed. It appears we have crash-landed in a strange forest..Analyzing...",
    "photosynthesis7": "Photosynthesis is an endothermic reaction. The energy for photosynthesis comes from light. Without light energy, photosynthesis cannot occur. Luckily we have some right here!",
    "finalScene-0002": "Thank you for everything. This will heal my damages, and allow me to live out here in peace. Please be careful on your way home! It looks like you have plenty of gas to get back!",
    "scene04-0004": "Wow thanks Buzz! This looks delicious! I’m surely going to have enough energy to get home now.",
    "scene03-0002": "Woah! Who is that? We must go find them!",
    "photosynthesisIntruction": "Press E to cause the photosynthesis reaction.",
    "combatscene4": "We have collected 10 of each! This should be plenty. Lets head down to continue searching for the ingredients for the tree's potion.",
    "farLeft": "Lets go!",
    "scene02-0004": "AH!!! A TALKING TREE",
    "continueGame": "CONTINUE",
    "EndGame": "COMPLETE",
    "scene02-0014": "You found the reactants necessary to get a gas product! Nice work.",
    "scene03-0001": "Distant voice: Help Help! Its freezing in here!",
    "scene03-0011": "Surely. When wood catches fire, a new substance is formed. This substance cannot be changed back to its original state, therefore it is a chemical reaction.",
    "triggerText1": "Hey, Buzz. Lets follow that elevator up. There is nothing else over here.",
    "scene03-0009": "Ah...lets follow this elevator up. My analyzer has obtained a signal from something we could potentially use.",
    "photosynthesis2": "Yes Hello!",
    "scene03-0016": "I want to get out of here, but I do not have enough energy to make it. I can smell some food somewhere in this cave though. Can you help me find it?",
    "spacePress": "Press Space or Tap Screen to Begin",
    "scene03-0010": "A piece of dry wood. I bet we can heat this up enough to cause a chemical reaction.",
    "scene03-0008": "We will need to find something flammable to unfreeze the block of ice they are trapped behind. Scanning...Scanning...",
    "scene02-0005": "OH A viridio giganto Quercus!",
    "photosynthesis5": "SANIA...we have the ingredients necessary to cause photosynthesis to take place. Maybe we can help this tree out.",
    "scene05-0006": "Precipitate reactions are rather interesting and beautiful part of chemistry.",
    "combatSceneS1": "We are finally back at it SANIA! Destroying pollution is what we do best!",
    "bugsFarRight": "Lets talk to Pete and get this precipitate reaction underway!",
    "scene02-0016": "Be careful out there though! Hazardous materials are flying around all over in outerspace!",
    "NeedFuel": "Combine reactants to create fuel (Press I)",
    "scene02-0012": "You can open your inventory by pressing I... Give it a shot! After that lets continue searching for the second REACTANT.",
    "scene05-0001": "In this section of the forest you need to be very careful. Not only are there moving platforms to navigate.",
    "scene02-0009": "Great! I need a potion. The only potion that will work is one that is created from the product of a PRECIPITATE REACTION. I will get into this later. First you need to go get the REACTANTS.",
    "photosynthesis3": "Another talking tree!",
    "scene01-0002": "Judging by my calculations, we are traveling at a safe speed. However, our trajectory is lining up with that tree!",
    "gasFarRight": "Now that you have both reactants we can combine them. Lets get back to the ship to find that potion!",
    "scene05-0008": "I cant wait to see this! Press I to open the inventory and mix the solutions.",
    "scene02-0007": "Lucky for you, this area of the forest has plenty of REACTANTS that can produce a GAS PRODUCT. If you promise to help me, I will help you get out of here so you can get back home.",
    "scene04-0005": "To thank you for your trouble, I want to give you this solution. It can be used as one of the ingredients for the Tree of Life’s potion.",
    "scene04-0002": "During a chemical reaction, a new substance is formed with different physical properties.",
    "scene02-0011": "Ah. It appears you have found the first REACTANT for the chemical reaction. Your inventory will be where we handle combining reactants",
    "scene02-0015": "Press on and find the ingredients for the potion. I will be waiting for you here! Its not like I can go anywhere anyway!",
    "finalScene-0003": "That’s right! Now that we know how to use the evidence of chemical reactions to navigate the world, we can take this knowledge back home and share it with our friends and family!",
    "photosynthesis9": "Thank you! Now I can use this glucose for food and release Oxygen into the atmosphere! Watch out for the lava up a head.",
    "finalScene-0004": "Lets go Buzz! Lets go SANIA!",
    "scene03-0015": "Buzz! Im glad to see you. I was just out for a stroll when the cave temperature suddenly dropped freezing everything. I was trapped. I am so hungry.",
    "scene03-0014": "OH WOW! PETE! What are you doing in here!?",
    "scene06-0002": "Awesome work! Lets go repair the Tree of Life and finally go home!",
    "scene05-0004": "Be careful!",
    "scene05-0002": "There are also little chemical reaction bugs running around. Their jelly is what we need for the potion's reaction.",
    "newGame": "NEW GAME",
    "photosynthesis1": "Wow! Check it out. A tiny tree is sprouting in this cave.",
    "scene04-0001": "I used the burning wood for this fire. Let us cook this carrot.",
    "scene03-0003": "Scanning... Scanning... Life-form detected.",
    "scene03-0013": "This will be interesting since burning wood is an example of an exothermic reaction. An exothermic reaction is one in which energy is released! Photosynthesis is the complete opposite. How neat!",
    "scene05-0005": "Alright! I have enough Jelly. Now all I need to do is create the precipitate reaction.",
    "scene03-0007": "Scanning...Scanning... Life form is closer now.",
    "scene03-0018": "Beep beep",
    "scene05-0010": "Wow! You got the potion. Such a neat chemical reaction! Lets stir it up and bring it to the tree now.",
    "scene06-0001": "Lets shake this bottle up so we can officially create this potion.",
    "InitializeText": "Initializing...",
    "interactPrompt": "Press E to interact",
    "finalScene-0001": "Hi! Welcome back! I am so glad to see you. I see you've brought the potion! YAY!",
    "scene01-0001": "Oh no! It looks like I'm running out of gas for my balloon! This is going to be a rough landing!",
    "scene04-0003": "In this case, several of the carrot’s physical properties will change. The color, just like the wood. The odor will change. The carrot's softness changes too! All this happens when exposed to a drastic temperature change.",
    "scene01-0003": "Well...HERE WE GO!!",
    "caveFR": "My analyzer is picking up on something the other way.",
    "scene02-0003": "HEY THERE!",
    "scene02-0008": "I will absolutely help!",
    "treeBubble2": "Press E to give the product to the tree",
    "photosynthesis6": "In photosynthesis, plants make the simple sugar, glucose (C6H12O6) from carbon dioxide (CO2), and water (H2O). They also release oxygen (O2) in the process.",
    "scene04-0006": "To obtain the second REACTANT we need to go into a dangerous part of the forest. Lets go!",
    "startCooking": "Start Cooking",
    "scene03-0012": "Lets combine the lava and the wood. Perhaps this will cause a flame."
