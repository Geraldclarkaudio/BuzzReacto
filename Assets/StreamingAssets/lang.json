    "scene01-0001": "BUZZ: Oh no! It looks like I'm running out of gas for my balloon! This is going to be a rough landing!",
    "scene01-0002": "S.A.N.I.A: Judging by my calculations, we are traveling at a safe speed. However, our trajectory is lining up with that tree!",
    "scene01-0003": "BUZZ: Well...HERE WE GO!!",
    "scene01-0004": "BUZZ AND S.A.N.I.A: AH!!! buzz click click",
    "scene02-0001": "That was scary! Luckily we are still in one piece. Well...I am.",
    "scene02-0002": "Yes. Lucky indeed. It appears we have crash landed in a strange forest..Analyzing...",
    "scene02-0003": "HEY THERE!",
    "scene02-0004": "AH!!! A TALKING TREE",
    "scene02-0005": "OH A viridio giganto Quercus!",
    "scene02-0006": "Yea! I can talk! You crashed your ship into me, and it appears you�re stranded. Let me help you. You�ve landed in Reaction Forest. Everything here functions using chemical reactions. Your balloon has run out of gas.",
    "scene02-0007": "Lucky for you, this area of the forest has plenty of REACTANTS that can produce a GAS PRODUCT. If you promise to help me, I�ll help you get out of here so you can get back home.",
    "scene02-0008": "I will absolutely help!",
    "scene02-0009": "Great! I need a potion. The only potion that will work is one that is created from the product of a PRECIPITATE REACTION. I�ll get into this later. First you need to go get the REACTANTS.",
    "scene02-0010": "Let's get your balloon filled up again so you can find the REACTANTS for my potion. Be careful though. The ground moves in some places! Fall off and you will end up back here talking to me.",
    "scene02-0011": "Ah. It appears you have found the first REACTANT for the chemical reaction. Your inventory will be where we handle combining reactants",
    "scene02-0012": "You can open your inventory by pressing I. Give it a shot! After that lets continue searching for the second reactant.",
    "scene02-0013": "Viola! You did it! Now we have a product that produces a gas. Lets fix up our ship and get our balloon inflated.",
    "scene02-0014": "You found the reactants necessary to get a gas product! Nice work.",
    "scene02-0015": "Press on and find the ingredients for the potion. I will be waiting for you here! Its not like I can go anywhere anyway!",
    "scene03-0001": "Distant voice: Help Help! Its freezing in here!",
    "scene03-0002": "Woah! Who is that? We gotta go find them!",
    "scene03-0003": "Scanning... Scanning... Life-form detected.",
    "scene03-0004": "Lets go S.A.N.I.A",
    "scene03-0005": "beep beep click brrrr",
    "scene03-0006": "The sunlight peering through the roof of this cave is making this spot very warm.",
    "scene03-0007": "I am sure it is a nice experience. I however cannot feel anything. Scanning...Scanning... Life form is closer now.",
    "scene03-0008": "We will need to find something flammable to unfreeze the block of ice they are trapped behind. Scanning...Scanning...",
    "scene03-0009": "Ah...lets follow this elevator up. My analyzer has obtained a signal from something we could potentially use.",
    "scene03-0010": "A piece of dry wood. I bet we can get this to heat up enough to cause a flame to happen.",
    "scene03-0011": "Surely. When wood catches fire, a new substance is formed. This substance cannot be changed back to its original state, therefore it is a chemical reaction.",
    "scene03-0012": "Lets go back to where its warm and make this chemical reaction take place!",
    "scene03-0013": "beep boop",
    "scene03-0014": "OH WOW! PETE! What are you doing in here!?",
    "scene03-0015": "Buzz! Im glad to see you. I was just out for a stroll when the cave temperature suddenly dropped freezing everything. I was trapped. I am so hungry.",
    "scene03-0016": "I want to get out of here, but I don not have enough energy to make it. I can smell some food somewhere in this cave though. Can you help me find it?",
    "scene03-0017": "I'm on it! Lets go S.A.N.I.A!",
    "scene03-0018": "Beep beep",
    "scene03-0019": "Ah you found a Daucus carota.",
    "scene03-0020": "A carrot. Pete would LOVE this. Lets go bring this to him.",

    "scene04-0001": "I used the burning wood for this fire. Let us cook this carrot.",
    "scene04-0002": "During a chemical reaction, a new substance is formed with different physical properties.",
    "scene04-0003": "In this case, several of the carrot’s physical properties will change. The color, just like the wood. The odor will change. The carrot's softness changes too! All this happens when exposed to a drastic temperature change.",
    "scene04-0004": "Wow thanks Buzz! This looks delicious! I’m surely going to have enough energy to get home now.",
    "scene04-0005": "To thank you for your trouble, I want to give you this solution. It can be used as one of the ingredients for the Tree of Life’s potion.",
    "scene04-0006": "To obtain the second reactant we need to go into a dangerous part of the forest. Lets go!",
    "startCooking": "Start Cooking",
    "TapHereButton": "Tap Here To Cook!",

    "scene05-0001": "In this section of the forest you need to be very careful. Not only are there moving platforms to navigate.",
    "scene05-0002": "There are also mean little chemical reaction bugs running around. If you are not careful they will bite you!",
    "scene05-0003": "Be sure to jump on them when you see them. Collect enough of their jelly, and you will have the ingredients necessay for the potion.",
    "scene05-0004": "Be careful!",
    "scene05-0005": "Alright! I have enough Jelly. Now all I need to do is create the precipitate reaction.",
    "scene05-0006": "Precipitate reactions are rather interesting and beautiful part of chemistry.",
    "scene05-0007": "Two solutions are combined and a quick exchange of partners occurs causing the formation of an insoluble solid that falls or precipitates to the bottom of the container the solutions are combined in.",
    "scene05-0008": "I cant wait to see this! Press I to open the inventory and mix the solutions.",


    "scene05-0009": "We have it! Lets go talk to Pete and make our way back to the Tree of Life!",

    "scene05-0010": "Wow! You got the potion. Such a neat chemical reaction! Lets stir it up and bring it to the tree now.",

    "scene06-0001": "Lets shake this bottle up so we can officially create this potion.",
    "scene06-0002": "Awesome work! Lets go repair the Tree of Life and finally go home!"
